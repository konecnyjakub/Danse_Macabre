A new version is out. It is only available for Wesnoth 1.18, some changes had to be made to make it compatible with that version so it should work the same as on Wesnoth 1.14. There are also several fixes/improvements made through the years since the last version. The most notable ones are: added portrait for Giant Ant; fixed defense sound of bats animation; changed experience of max level units with default amla to level * 50; Spelk, Pech, Gingly, Neckfrill and Orlok now have loyal icon instead of the hero one; ghosts are recruitable only if Gingly is present. Shiki/@sevu contributed some of those patches. Some dialogues were also improved (suggested by Konrad2/@Konrad22).
